### Purpose
TransferIQ is a **decision-support tool**, not a prediction engine.
It helps programs evaluate **tradeoffs under uncertainty**.

---

### Modeling Approach
- Regularized regression (Elastic Net)
- Transparent coefficients
- Stable outputs
- No black-box AI

---

### Target Variable
- Year-1 snaps played post-transfer

---

### What This Tool Does NOT Do
- Predict wins or championships
- Replace scouting or film
- Rank players by hype
- Make gambling recommendations

---

### Why This Matters
Transfer recruiting is capital allocation.
This tool helps programs avoid inefficient spend and improve expected outcomes.
